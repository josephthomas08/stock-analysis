# Green Stock Analysis 

## Overview of Project

Steve has requested for our company  to look into 1000â€™s of stocks and research for stock which could possibly be a good investment for his parents to pursue. Our team were expected to us VBA  in Excel to expose the findings by looking onto total daily volumen and annual return. Our team were also requested to look into the possiblity  to execute the analysis faster by refactoring.

### Purpose 
The purpose was initially to see the desire of Steeve parents to invest in DQ Stock which we had evaluate for the two years and found a negtive dip thereby realising that it was not a good stock to pick. Later it was decided to look into other 11 stocks along with DQ and see right stocks available for investment. Once the excercise was completed Steeve expressed his desire to us for providing a more efficent way to dive deep into multiple stocks using VBA.
This was decided mutually within the team to be achieved by refactoring our code. Further we plan to provide a detailed insight to steeve if refactoring really provided us with efficent alaysis.

## Results
### Refactoring the Code

Our team worked on the code to be more efficent by switiching the nesting order of "For Loops". We created 4 different arrays 
* tickers
* tickervolumes
* tickerstarting prices
* tickerendingprices.

Please note that we have used the ticker array to establish ticker symbol of a stock. tickerindex was further utilized as a variable to match the other three arrays with ticker.
